# Developing-Android-Apps-with-Kotlin
This repository is summing up all the apps created during the course by Udacity Developing Android Apps with Kotlin

- Dice Roller: Build your first app that covers basic Android components like displaying texts and images as well as a tour of the Android tools you'll be using through this course.
- About Me: designing your app's UI is the first step to a great user experience. This project covers all the basics of UI layout design with all the popular view types focus on the ConstraintLayout with data Binding.
- App Navigation: building multiple screens on Android has never been easier with the Android Jetpack Navigation Component. Trivia app using multiple fragments and conditional navigation, back stack manipulation, up vs back button, menu, explicit vs implicit intents, navigation listeners, transition animations.
- Activity & Fragment Lifecycle: understanding the concept of Lifecycles for both is what makes a great Android developer. Exploring this topic with "Dessert Pusher" app. Logging with Timber, lifecycle callbacks, onSaveInstanceState's role, configure changes, shutdown state loss. 
- App Architecture (UI Layer): using Architecture Components to design even the most complicated app ideas. Intoducing MVVM architecture pattern. Combine ViewModels with LiveData to build this fun "Guess it" game.
- App Architecture (Persistence): Sleep Tracker app is all about data persistence, there are many ways to store data permanently, but with Room, additional LiveData, ViewModel(ViewModelFactory for dependency injection) things have become even easier than ever before. Multithreading and Coroutines, Transformation Maps, observable state variables and Snackbar.
- RecyclerView: LinearLayout vs GridLayout. Adapter pattern -> ViewHolder -> Layout Managers. Tipps on refactoring onBindViewHolder and onCreateViewHolder, improving data refresh with DiffUtil vs notifyDataSetChanged(), binding adapter.
- Connect to Internet: need some live data in the app? In this project Retrofit was used to communicate with any RESTful services out there. Moshi was used for parsing JSON response and Glide to display images from web in Mars Real Estate app.
- Behind the Scenes: everything about offline caching in Dev Bytes app. Repository pattern, WorkManager, scheduling background work with prefetching.
- Design for Everyone: GDG Finder app. Coming up with a good design for an app is always hard, but creating a great design is more than just colors and layouts. Let's build an app that is designed for everyone, everywhere!
